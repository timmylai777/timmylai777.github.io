        <h3>Auto-correcting Software (Python) Feb 2020</h3>
        <li>Created a program that auto-corrects theuserâ€™s typos based on differing characters within a word and matching
            it to the most accurate word within a given list</li>
        <h3>Insects Video Game (Python) April 2020</h3>
        <li>Developed a game in which the goal is defend a home base using insect troops against intruding insects</li>
        <li>Used an object-oriented program in Python in order to give insects different powers and characteristics than others</li>
        <h3>Navigation Map (Java) October 2020</h3>
        <li>Developed a program that gives specific driving and walking directions and routes on a map to a desired destination</li>
        <li>Used a Binary Search Tree in order to narrow down closest locations and desired destinations</li>
        <h3>Explore With Chess (Java) November 2020</h3>
        <li>Developed a program that enables the user to interact with the keyboard and explore a randomized world using various chess pieces</li>
        <li>Used pseudo-randomness to bring variety to each world, giving the user a fresh, new experience on each new game</li>
        <h3>Tic-Tac-Toe Solver (Python) June 2021</h3>
        <li>Developed a program that uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to solve the game of Tic-Tac-Toe</li>
        <li>Allows the user to play Tic-Tac-Toe against the computer</li>
        <li>Used a minimax tree to optimize the moves of the computer</li>

        <h3>First Robotics (Spring 2019)</h3>
        <li>Collaborated with other students in building a robot that is able to move, pick up yellow cubes, and stack them in an orderly manner</li>
        <li>Competed in the FIRST Robotics Competition</li>
        <li>I specifically contributed to the programming of the robot and also other mechanical duties, including sawing,
            drilling, and assembling the robot</li>
        <h3>Chemical Engineering Car (Fall 2019)</h3>
        <li>Worked with students in designing a toy car that is powered by chemical reactions. The goal was to reach a certain distance and stop at that exact distance.</li>
        <li>My team specifically made a battery that was powered by the chemical reaction between lead and sulfuric acid</li>
        <li>We experimentally changed the format and orientation of the lead sheets in their interaction with the sulfuric
            acid in order to obtain the ideal voltage that would power the car</li>
