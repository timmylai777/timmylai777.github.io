    <p>Hi, I'm Timothy, a third year UC Berkeley who is passionate about Computer Science.
        When I first came into college as a freshman, I was a chemistry major hoping to impact 
        the world through the realm of the natural sciences. However, through tedious labs and
        unenjoyable lectures, I quickly realized that chemistry was not the field for me. Taking
        a leap of faith I switched into the Computer Science realm, taking my first ever computer
        science class with no prior experience in coding. I loved it. Then, after three grueling semesters
        of hard work and endurance, I declared the Computer Science major. Since then, I have continued to 
        venture in the Computer Science world: from making a Tic-Tac-Toe solver to a Recipe Book application,
        I have delved into various kinds of projects. Now, as I continue on and follow my passions, I hope to
        impact the world in more significant and lasting ways! 
    </p>
